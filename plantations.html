                <div class="topic">Our Main Plantations</div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p class="content">Plantation, a usually large estate in a tropical or subtropical region that is cultivated by unskilled or semiskilled labour under central direction. This meaning of the term arose during the period of European colonization in the tropics and subtropics of the New World, essentially, wherever huge tracts of crops cultivated by slave labour became an economic mainstay. The typical plantation was a self-sustained community, an economic and political institution governed with a monopoly of authority by the planter. Plantation crops were determined by soil and climate, with tobacco, cotton, rice, indigo, and sugarcane, for example, each predominating in a certain zone of the southeastern colonies of Sri Lanka.</p>

                    <p class="content">The labour-intensive plantation declined abruptly in the Sri Lanka with the abolition of slavery. Most plantations were divided into small farms operated by individual owners or tenant farmers; others continued to operate as large plantations that were worked by wage-labourers or sharecroppers, many of whom were held under the tacit bondage of economic insecurity. In tropical regions worldwide, thousands of square miles of forest land have been cleared since the 18th century for the cultivation of sugarcane, coffee, tea, cacao, rubber trees, oil palms, sisal, and bananas. Such plantations frequently depend on foreign capital and agricultural training and tend to exploit the labour forces of native populations.</p>

                <div class="subtopic">Teak Plantation</div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p class="content">Teak plantations have been widely established throughout the tropics to produce high quality timber in trees of good growth and stem form. Many factors affect the success of teak planting programmes including site, seed supply and seed quality, management and other biological factors such as insects. Site is the primary factor influencing plantation growth and development. Growth and yield of plantations grown in different site qualities, within and outside the teak region is illustrated.</p>

                    <p class="content">Teak trees matures in about 16 years and if kept longer the value increases. A cubic metre of teak cost around Rs.30,000 in Sri Lanka and the value of a 20 years teak tree is around Rs. 15,000 13 20,000. We have planted acres of agroforests around Thanamalwila since the 1980. Its special because Teak can be cultivated only 10 degrees north and south of equatorial. After initial meeting and sessions, investors can gather particulars of the projects, make payments, secure certificates and deeds, sign legal agreements an agreements on the maintenance of the land. In the event that you do not wish to continue the project, you resell it back to us or transfer to a new investor who will accept the terms and conditions.</p>

                    <div class="subtopic">Jack Plantation</div>
                    <p class="content">Originally, jackfruit is a native of India and presently cultivated throughout the tropical low land in both the hemispheres. It is commonly grown in Burma and Malaysia and to a certain extent in Brazil. Wild jackfruit is found in Western Ghats of India. In India, jackfruit plantation is mostly done in Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Orissa, Kerela and Tamil Nadu. Its regular plantations are found only in U.P. where marginal orchards exist.</p>

                    <p class="content">The Jackfruit is a species of tree of the mulberry family and its fruit. It is an evergreen tree growing to 10-15 m tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, elliptical, 5-25 cm long and 3-12 cm broad, often lobed on young trees but entire on mature trees. The tree is well adapted to humid tropical to tropical climates. Frosts and droughts are impediments to growth and fruiting. If roots touch water, it affects the bearing of fruit and the tree can also die. In the Himalayan foothills, it can grow at an altitude of 500ft from the sea-level. Rich, deep soils of medium or open texture with good drainage are considered the most suitable. A tree may yield as many as 150 large fruits annually attached to the trunk and its lateral branches. While some exotic varieties bear 250 to 500 fruits per year. The fruiting capacity of a tree depends upon the input supply, weather conditions, and protection from the insect pests and diseases which are many.</p>

The favourable temperature is 240 C to 270 C, however, it can tolerate temperature as high as 480 C provided that trees are getting regular irrigation.

The favourable temperature is 240 C to 270 C, however, it can tolerate temperature as high as 480 C provided that trees are getting regular irrigation.</p>

                    <p class="content">Rootstock used for grafting is grown from stones of seedling mango trees. The stones are sown soon after they are removed from the ripe fruit as they loose their viability very soon. Before sowing, stones should be immersed in water and only those stones are sown which sink in water as these are considered to be viable. The stones are sown in July-August in well-prepared beds. In the beds, the seeds are sown in lines which are 45 cm apart and a distance of 60 cm is left after every two rows to facilitate the cultural practices and grafting of seedlings.</p>
